# calculator

Problem
Create a calculator that has the function of add, subtract, multiply and divide.
It should have a clear and a result button. The calculator should also be able to perform calculations with fractional numbers.
The calculator should have numbers between 0 and 9.

Plan
The user input is made via an UI by clicking the buttons from 0 to 9 and choosing an operator between two numbers.
After processing the output should be displayed on upper part of the calculator.

Pseudocode

CHECK for first number entry which is complete after an operator has been entered.
DECIDE which function will be performed based on the operator.
CHECK for second number which is complete after an operator or after pressing result button.
IF an operator has been choosen instead of equal button then the the result of the two numbers is the first number in the next calculation.
